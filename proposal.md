## Case Title
AI Fitness & Meal Planner

## Background
Many people aim to live healthier lives but struggle to find the time, motivation, or financial resources to maintain consistent fitness routines and balanced nutrition. Existing fitness and meal apps often provide generic content or require costly subscriptions for personalization. This project seeks to create an AI-driven web platform that intelligently combines workout and meal planning into a unified experience. By leveraging AI personalization, weekly replanning, and user-specific progress tracking, the platform will act as a digital personal trainer and nutritionist — simple, affordable, and adaptive.

## Purpose
The objective of this project is to develop a comprehensive, AI-assisted web application that automatically generates and adjusts personalized workout and meal plans. Users will receive tailored recommendations based on their fitness goals (e.g., stronger legs, better endurance, weight loss), preferences, and progress over time. The system will enable users to log results, replan weekly, and visualize their improvement, promoting long-term health habits and consistency.

## Target Users
**Primary Users:**

1. Individuals who want structured fitness and meal plans adapted to their goals.  
2. People seeking affordable, intelligent alternatives to personal trainers or dietitians.  
3. Busy professionals who need automatic weekly fitness and meal organization.

## Risk Assessment

**Technical Risks:**
- **AI Output Accuracy:** The AI may produce inconsistent or unrealistic workout or meal plans.  
  - *Mitigation:* Define strict JSON schemas for AI output, implement validation checks, and allow human override through manual editing.  
- **API Reliability:** The OpenAI API could experience downtime or rate limiting.  
  - *Mitigation:* Use request caching, fallback templates, and retry logic with exponential backoff.  
- **Performance and Scalability:** Increased user activity could affect response times or database performance.  
  - *Mitigation:* Optimize database queries, use indexes, and enable Supabase Realtime selectively.  
- **Data Privacy and Security:** The system handles sensitive personal and health-related data.  
  - *Mitigation:* Use encrypted connections, Row Level Security (RLS), and GDPR-compliant data retention policies.  

**Project Risks:**
- **Scope Management:** The MVP may grow beyond the planned 5-week timeline.  
  - *Mitigation:* Maintain a clearly defined MVP scope and prioritize “must-have” features over optional ones.  
- **AI Integration Complexity:** AI prompts may require multiple iterations for consistent results.  
  - *Mitigation:* Test prompt reliability early in development and prepare fallback rule-based logic for key functions.  
- **Timeline Pressure:** Tight project deadlines could affect testing quality.  
  - *Mitigation:* Integrate testing from Week 47 onward and allocate time for quality assurance before launch.  

**User Experience Risks:**
- **User Motivation:** Users may lose interest after initial setup if feedback is too generic.  
  - *Mitigation:* Add a reward system, progress tracking, and personalized motivational feedback.  
- **Accessibility and Usability:** The interface may not display properly across all devices.  
  - *Mitigation:* Conduct responsive design testing and follow accessibility best practices (WCAG).  

**Assumptions:**
- AI-assisted development increases productivity by 40–50% for standard coding tasks.  
- Supabase and PostgreSQL can handle the expected workload (100 concurrent users).  
- OpenAI’s API remains available and stable during the project.  
- Users are willing to adopt an AI-driven fitness and meal planning solution.  
- The 5-week BMAD timeline is sufficient for delivering a complete MVP with core functionality.
