## Executive Summary

To develop a comprehensive, AI-assisted web application that automatically generates and adjusts personalized workout and meal plans, promoting long-term health habits and consistency.

---

## Core Vision

### Problem Statement

Many people aim to live healthier lives but struggle to find the time, motivation, or financial resources to maintain consistent fitness routines and balanced nutrition. Existing fitness and meal apps often provide generic content or require costly subscriptions for personalization.

### Proposed Solution

The objective of this project is to develop a comprehensive, AI-assisted web application that automatically generates and adjusts personalized workout and meal plans. Users will receive tailored recommendations based on their fitness goals (e.g., stronger legs, better endurance, weight loss), preferences, and progress over time. The system will enable users to log results, replan weekly, and visualize their improvement, promoting long-term health habits and consistency.

### Key Differentiators

The core "magic" is the AI-driven personalization and dynamic adaptation of fitness and meal plans, making healthy living accessible, consistent, and highly engaging through intelligent onboarding, flexible plan adjustments, and user control.

## Target Users

### Primary Users

1. Individuals who want structured fitness and meal plans adapted to their goals.
2. People seeking affordable, intelligent alternatives to personal trainers or dietitians.
3. Busy professionals who need automatic weekly fitness and meal organization.

### Business & Technical Metrics:
