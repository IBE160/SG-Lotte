### Story 3.2: Application Settings

As an engaged user,
I want a settings page to manage application preferences,
So I can customize my experience.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** I navigate to the settings page
**When** the page loads
**Then** I see options to manage dark mode and notification preferences
**And** changes to these settings are saved and applied immediately

**Prerequisites:** Epic 1 completion.

**Technical Notes:** Frontend UI development based on `settings_dark.html`, API endpoints to save user settings.
