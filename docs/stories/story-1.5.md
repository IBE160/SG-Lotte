### Story 1.5: Initial AI Plan Generation & Display

As a new user who has completed onboarding,
I want to immediately see my first AI-generated "diagnostic" workout and meal plan on my dashboard,
So I can begin my health journey.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** I have completed the onboarding flow
**When** my dashboard loads
**Then** a 7-day personalized workout and meal plan is generated by the AI (OpenAI GPT-4)
**And** the generated plan is displayed on the dashboard, similar to `dashboard_dark.html` (showing today's plan)
**And** the plan details are stored in the database

**Prerequisites:** Story 1.4

**Technical Notes:** Backend service (`ai_plan_generator.py`) for AI interaction, API endpoint to trigger plan generation, database integration to store plans. Frontend integration to display on dashboard.
