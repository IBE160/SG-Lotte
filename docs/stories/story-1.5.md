### Story 1.5: Initial AI Plan Generation & Display
Status: Backlog

As a new user who has completed onboarding,
I want to immediately see my first AI-generated "diagnostic" workout and meal plan on my dashboard,
So I can begin my health journey.

**Acceptance Criteria:** [Source: docs/sprint-artifacts/tech-spec-epic-1.md]

*   **Given** I have completed the onboarding flow
*   **When** my dashboard loads
*   **Then** a 7-day personalized workout and meal plan is generated by the AI (OpenAI GPT-4)
*   **And** the generated plan is displayed on the dashboard, similar to `dashboard_dark.html` (showing today's plan)
*   **And** the plan details are stored in the database

**Prerequisites:** Story 1.4

**Tasks:**
*   **AC 1.5.1:** Implement AI plan generation service (`ai_plan_generator.py`).
*   **AC 1.5.2:** Create API endpoint to trigger plan generation.
*   **AC 1.5.3:** Integrate database to store generated plans.
*   **AC 1.5.4:** Implement frontend integration to display plan on dashboard.
*   **Testing:** API test to validate structure of AI-generated plan; E2E test to verify display on dashboard.

**Technical Notes:**
Backend service (`ai_plan_generator.py`) for AI interaction, API endpoint to trigger plan generation, database integration to store plans. Frontend integration to display on dashboard.

**Architecture patterns and constraints:**
*   Backend service for AI interaction with OpenAI GPT-4.
*   API endpoint for triggering plan generation.
*   Database integration for storing plans.
*   Frontend integration for displaying plans on dashboard.
