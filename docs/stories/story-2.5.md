### Story 2.5: New Plan Notification
Status: Backlog

As an active user,
I want to be notified when my new weekly plans are ready,
So I know when to check for updates.

**Acceptance Criteria:** [Source: docs/sprint-artifacts/tech-spec-epic-2.md]

*   **Given** a new plan has been generated by the AI
*   **When** I open the app
*   **Then** I receive an in-app notification confirming the new plan
*   **And** I can easily navigate to the new plan from the notification

**Prerequisites:** Story 2.3.

**Tasks:**
*   **AC 2.5.1:** Implement in-app notification UI to confirm new plans.
