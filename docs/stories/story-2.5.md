### Story 2.5: New Plan Notification

As an active user,
I want to be notified when my new weekly plans are ready,
So I know when to check for updates.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** a new plan has been generated by the AI
**When** I open the app
**Then** I receive an in-app notification confirming the new plan
**And** I can easily navigate to the new plan from the notification

**Prerequisites:** Story 2.3.

**Technical Notes:** Frontend notification UI based on `feedback_patterns_dark.html`, API endpoint to trigger/manage in-app notifications.
