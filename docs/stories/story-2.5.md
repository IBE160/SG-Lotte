### Story 2.5: New Plan Notification
Status: drafted

As an active user,
I want to be notified when my new weekly plans are ready,
So I know when to check for updates.

**Acceptance Criteria:** [Source: docs/sprint-artifacts/tech-spec-epic-2.md]

*   **Given** a new plan has been generated by the AI
*   **When** I open the app
*   **Then** I receive an in-app notification confirming the new plan
*   **And** I can easily navigate to the new plan from the notification

**Prerequisites:** Story 2.3.

**Tasks:**
*   **Task 2.5.1:** Implement the in-app notification UI to confirm new plans. (AC: 2.5.1)
*   **Task 2.5.2:** Implement the navigation from the notification to the new plan. (AC: 2.5.2)
*   **Task 2.5.3:** Create the backend API endpoint to trigger and manage in-app notifications. (AC: 2.5.1)
*   **Testing Subtasks:**
    *   Write a frontend component test for the notification UI. (AC: 2.5.1)
    *   Write an API test for the notification management endpoint. (AC: 2.5.1)
    *   Write an E2E test to verify the notification is received and can be navigated. (AC: 2.5.1, 2.5.2)

**Technical Notes:**
Frontend notification UI based on `feedback_patterns_dark.html`, API endpoint to trigger/manage in-app notifications.

**Architecture patterns and constraints:**
*   Frontend UI for in-app notifications.
*   Backend API for notification management.
