### Story 3.1: User Profile Page

As an engaged user,
I want a dedicated profile page to view and update my personal information and fitness goals,
So I have a central place to manage my identity.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** I navigate to the profile page
**When** the page loads
**Then** I see my name, email, and current fitness goals
**And** I can edit my personal details (e.g., name, primary goal) which are then saved to my user profile

**Prerequisites:** Epic 1 completion.

**Technical Notes:** Frontend UI development based on `profilepage_dark.html`, API endpoints for retrieving and updating user profile data.
