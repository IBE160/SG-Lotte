## 3. Implementation Plan

### 3.1. Task Breakdown

| Task ID | Description | Est. Time |
|---|---|---|
| 2.5.1 | Create the backend endpoint to trigger and manage in-app notifications. (AC: #1) | 3h |
| 2.5.2 | Implement the frontend UI for the notification based on the `feedback_patterns_dark.html` concept. (AC: #1, #2) | 3h |
| 2.5.3 | Implement the client-side logic to check for new notifications and display them. (AC: #1, #2) | 2h |
| 2.5.4 | **Test:** Write unit tests for the frontend UI of the notification. (AC: #1) | 1.5h |
| 2.5.5 | **Test:** Write integration tests for the backend endpoint to trigger and manage notifications. (AC: #1) | 1.5h |
| 2.5.6 | **Test:** Write E2E tests for the complete notification system, verifying display and navigation. (AC: #1, #2) | 1.5h |

### 3.2. Developer Notes

#### Project Structure Notes
*   The backend endpoint to trigger and manage notifications should be added to `backend/app/api/v1/endpoints/plans.py`.
*   The frontend UI for notifications should be created as a shared component, potentially in `frontend/src/components/shared/notifications/`.

#### General Notes
*   The notification should be non-intrusive but also clearly visible to the user. Upon successful creation of the new plan, the backend service creates a "Your new weekly plan is ready!" notification and saves it to the `notifications` table. [Source: docs/sprint-artifacts/tech-spec-epic-2.md#workflows-and-sequencing]
*   For the MVP, a check on app load is sufficient. The frontend will fetch unread notifications from the `GET /notifications` endpoint. [Source: docs/sprint-artifacts/tech-spec-epic-2.md#apis-and-interfaces]
