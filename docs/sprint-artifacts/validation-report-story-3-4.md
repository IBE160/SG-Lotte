# Story Quality Validation Report

Story: 3.4 - Plan Interruption Management
Outcome: PASS with issues (Critical: 0, Major: 0, Minor: 1)

## Critical Issues (Blockers)

(None)

## Major Issues (Should Fix)

(None)

## Minor Issues (Nice to Have)

- Story's Acceptance Criteria deviate slightly in granularity from the authoritative Tech Spec.
  Evidence: The story's Acceptance Criteria break down or combine authoritative Tech Spec ACs. While comprehensive, this slight deviation from the authoritative spec's granularity might require extra cross-referencing.
  Impact: While not a blocking issue, it could lead to minor confusion during traceability if not clearly understood.

## Successes

- All Acceptance Criteria elements (though slightly re-granularized) are present and align with the authoritative Tech Spec.
- All tasks reference at least one AC, ensuring good traceability between development work and requirements.
- Sufficient testing subtasks are present (3 testing tasks for 3 ACs).
- Previous story is drafted, so no continuity issues or unresolved review items expected.
- Story structure is complete and correct, including the "As a / I want / so that" format and initialized Dev Agent Record sections.
- All primary source documents cited (Tech Spec, PRD, Epics, Architecture) exist and are referenced with correct sections.
- Developer Notes now contain explicit citations and more specific architectural guidance, addressing previous feedback.
