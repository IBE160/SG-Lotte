# Story Quality Validation Report

**Story:** 2-1-workout-logging-ui - Workout Logging UI
**Outcome:** PASS with issues (Critical: 0, Major: 0, Minor: 1)

## Minor Issues (Nice to Have)

- **Testing Strategy Not Cited:** The Dev Notes section does not explicitly reference the testing strategy document (`testing-strategy.md`), although testing subtasks are included. It's recommended to cite the strategy for completeness.

## Successes

- The story correctly captures learnings from the previous story.
- All relevant source documents (epics, architecture, PRD) are cited.
- Acceptance criteria are well-defined and sourced from `epics.md`.
- Tasks are clearly mapped to acceptance criteria.
- The story structure and metadata are complete and correct.
