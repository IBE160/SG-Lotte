*   The User Story is well-formed using the "As a / I want / so that" format.
*   Acceptance Criteria are present, specific, testable, and atomic, and their content aligns well with the authoritative ACs defined in `tech-spec-epic-1.md`.
*   The "Tasks / Subtasks" section is present and all ACs are mapped to tasks, reflecting a frontend-only implementation for user registration with Supabase Auth.

*   The "Learnings from Previous Story" section correctly references story 1.2 and its completion.
*   The story correctly identifies that AI integration is not directly applicable to this specific story (1.3).
*   A "References" section is present with formal citations to `tech-spec-epic-1.md`, `epics.md`, `architecture-2025-11-30.md`, and `1-2-core-frontend-setup.md`.
