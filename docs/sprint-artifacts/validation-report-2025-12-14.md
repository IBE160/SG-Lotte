# Story Quality Validation Report

Story: 2-3 - AI-Driven Weekly Plan Adaptation Logic
Outcome: FAIL (Critical: 3, Major: 4, Minor: 1)

## Critical Issues (Blockers)

1.  **"Learnings from Previous Story" subsection missing**
    Evidence: The story file `2-3-ai-driven-weekly-plan-adaptation-logic.md` does not contain a "Dev Notes" section, and therefore lacks the "Learnings from Previous Story" subsection. The previous story `2-2-meal-logging-ui.md` has completion notes and a file list, indicating content that should be carried forward.
2.  **Tech spec exists but not cited**
    Evidence: `tech-spec-epic-2.md` exists at `C:\IT_studier\IBE160_Programmering_med_KI\Prosjektmappe\Prosjekt\SG-Lotte\docs\sprint-artifacts\tech-spec-epic-2.md`, but there are no citations to this document in the story.
3.  **Epics exists but not cited**
    Evidence: `epics.md` exists at `C:\IT_studier\IBE160_Programmering_med_KI\Prosjektmappe\Prosjekt\SG-Lotte\docs\epics.md`, but there are no citations to this document in the story.

## Major Issues (Should Fix)

1.  **Story ACs do not match tech spec ACs.**
    Evidence: The Acceptance Criteria listed in the story `2-3-ai-driven-weekly-plan-adaptation-logic.md` are functionally oriented, while the authoritative ACs for Story 2.3 in `tech-spec-epic-2.md` are technically oriented and distinct. There is a clear mismatch between the two sets of criteria.
2.  **No tasks defined in the story.**
    Evidence: The story file `2-3-ai-driven-weekly-plan-adaptation-logic.md` does not contain an explicit "Tasks/Subtasks" section.
3.  **Dev Notes section is missing.**
    Evidence: The story file `2-3-ai-driven-weekly-plan-adaptation-logic.md` lacks a "Dev Notes" section, which should contain important subsections like "Architecture patterns and constraints" and "References (with citations)".
4.  **Missing "Dev Agent Record" section.**
    Evidence: The story file `2-3-ai-driven-weekly-plan-adaptation-logic.md` does not contain a "Dev Agent Record" section.

## Minor Issues (Nice to Have)

1.  **Missing "Change Log" section.**
    Evidence: The story file `2-3-ai-driven-weekly-adaptation-logic.md` does not contain a "Change Log" section.

## Successes

*   The user story statement follows the "As a / I want / so that" format.
*   The story file is located in the correct directory.

## User Alert and Remediation

Outcome: FAIL
Summary of issues:
1.  **Critical:** "Learnings from Previous Story" subsection is MISSING.
2.  **Critical:** Tech spec exists but not cited.
3.  **Critical:** Epics exists but not cited.

I cannot proceed with auto-improving the story as this requires regeneration of affected sections which is beyond the scope of this validation task.

Please review the detailed findings in the report.
