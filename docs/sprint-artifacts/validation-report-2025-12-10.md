## Section Results

### Overall Specification Quality
Pass Rate: 11/11 (100%)

✓ Overview clearly ties to PRD goals
Evidence: "Overview" and "Objectives and Scope" sections (lines 7-18). The description of AI-driven personalization aligns with the product brief's stated goal of "AI Fitness & Meal Planner."

Evidence: "In-Scope" (lines 20-28) and "Out-of-Scope" (lines 31-36) sub-sections under "Objectives and Scope."

✓ Design lists all services/modules with responsibilities
Evidence: "Services and Modules" sub-section under "Detailed Design" (lines 50-61).

✓ Data models include entities, fields, and relationships
Evidence: "Data Models and Contracts" sub-section under "Detailed Design" (lines 65-71). Provides entities and high-level field descriptions/relationships.

✓ APIs/interfaces are specified with methods and schemas
Evidence: "APIs and Interfaces" sub-section under "Detailed Design" (lines 75-80).

✓ NFRs: performance, security, reliability, observability addressed
Evidence: "Non-Functional Requirements" section and its sub-sections (lines 103-137).

✓ Dependencies/integrations enumerated with versions where known
Evidence: "Dependencies and Integrations" section and its sub-sections (lines 141-166).

✓ Acceptance criteria are atomic and testable
Evidence: "Acceptance Criteria (Authoritative)" section (lines 170-209).

✓ Traceability maps AC → Spec → Components → Tests
Evidence: "Traceability Mapping" table (lines 213-236).

✓ Risks/assumptions/questions listed with mitigation/next steps
Evidence: "Risks, Assumptions, Open Questions" section (lines 240-248).

✓ Test strategy covers all ACs and critical paths
Evidence: "Test Strategy Summary" section (lines 252-264).

## Failed Items
(None)

## Partial Items
(None)

## Recommendations
1. Must Fix: (None)
2. Should Improve: (None)
3. Consider:
    - For data models (Checklist Item 4), consider adding more detailed fields/types in a separate section or linked document if available, or specify that this will be handled in a more detailed design phase.
    - For APIs/interfaces (Checklist Item 5), consider adding explicit API schemas (e.g., using OpenAPI/Swagger syntax) if this level of detail is expected for the target audience of the tech spec.
