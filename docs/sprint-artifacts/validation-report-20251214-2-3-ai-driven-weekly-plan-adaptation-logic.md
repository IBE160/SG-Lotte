# Story Quality Validation Report

Story: 2-3 - AI-Driven Weekly Plan Adaptation Logic
Outcome: PASS with issues (Critical: 0, Major: 1, Minor: 0)

## Critical Issues (Blockers)

(none)

## Major Issues (Should Fix)

1.  **Tasks Not Mapped to Acceptance Criteria:** None of the tasks in the "Tasks/Subtasks" section are mapped to their corresponding Acceptance Criteria. Each task should include a reference like `(AC: #1)` to ensure all requirements are covered by implementation work.

## Minor Issues (Nice to Have)

(none)

## Successes

-   **Excellent Continuity:** The story correctly captures and builds upon the learnings from the previous story (2-2).
-   **Strong Source Referencing:** The story correctly cites the Epic 2 Tech Spec and the main epics file.
-   **Clear Dev Notes:** The "Architecture patterns and constraints" section provides specific, actionable guidance for the developer.
-   **Well-Formed Structure:** The story adheres to all structural requirements, including status, user story format, and initialized sections.
-   **Comprehensive Tasking:** The story includes a good breakdown of backend, infrastructure, and testing tasks.

## Recommendations

-   **Must Fix:** Before development begins, edit the story to map all tasks to their respective Acceptance Criteria. For example: `[ ] Create the PlanAdaptationService module in app/services/ (AC: #2, #3)`.
