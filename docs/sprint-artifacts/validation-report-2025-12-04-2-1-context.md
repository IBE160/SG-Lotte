# Story Context Quality Validation Report

**Story Context:** 2-1-workout-logging-ui.context.xml
**Outcome:** PASS with issues (Critical: 0, Major: 0, Minor: 1)

## Minor Issues (Nice to Have)

-   **Insufficient Document References:** The `docs` section includes 4 relevant documents, but the checklist specifies "5-15". While the included documents are highly relevant, adding one more (e.g., a relevant test design document for Epic 2, or a coding standards document if one exists) would fully meet this guideline.

## Successes

-   Story fields (asA/iWant/soThat) are accurately captured.
-   Acceptance criteria and tasks/subtasks perfectly match the story draft.
-   Relevant code references are included, clearly indicating new additions.
-   The new API contract is well-defined.
-   Key development constraints are documented.
-   All project dependencies are correctly identified.
-   Comprehensive testing standards, locations, and ideas are provided.
-   The XML structure adheres to the `story-context` template.
