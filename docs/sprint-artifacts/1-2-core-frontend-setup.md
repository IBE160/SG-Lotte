# Story 1.2: Core Frontend Setup

Status: ready-for-dev

## Story

As a developer,
I want the Next.js frontend to be set up and connected to a Vercel deployment pipeline,
So that I can build UI components and have continuous deployment.

## Acceptance Criteria

1.  **Given** the project is initialized, **When** I set up the frontend, **Then** a Next.js app is created with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS. (Source: `tech-spec-epic-1.md`)
2.  **Given** the project is initialized, **When** I set up the frontend, **Then** a Vercel CI/CD pipeline is connected for automated deployments. (Source: `tech-spec-epic-1.md`)
3.  **Given** the project is initialized, **When** I set up the frontend, **Then** a basic API call from the frontend to the backend is successful. (Source: `tech-spec-epic-1.md`)

## Tasks / Subtasks

-   [ ] **Project Initialization (AC: #1):**
    -   [ ] Create a `frontend/` directory at the project root.
    -   [ ] Run `npx create-next-app@latest` within the `frontend/` directory.
    -   [ ] Select options for TypeScript and Tailwind CSS during setup.
    -   [ ] Verify the new Next.js application runs locally (`npm run dev`).
    -   [ ] **Testing:** Run `npm run lint` and `npm run test` to ensure code quality and no regressions.
-   [ ] **Supabase Client Setup (Prerequisite for AC #3):**
    -   [ ] Install the Supabase client library: `npm install @supabase/supabase-js`.
    -   [ ] Create a `.env.local` file in the `frontend/` directory with `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`.
    -   [ ] Create a Supabase client utility file (e.g., `frontend/src/lib/supabaseClient.ts`) to initialize and export the client.
-   [ ] **Vercel Integration (AC: #2):**
    -   [ ] Create a new project on the Vercel dashboard.
    -   [ ] Link the Vercel project to the GitHub repository.
    -   [ ] Configure the root directory in Vercel settings to be `frontend`.
    -   [ ] Add Supabase environment variables (`NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`) to the Vercel project settings.
    -   [ ] Trigger a deployment and verify it succeeds.
    -   [ ] **Testing:** Check the deployment logs in Vercel for any build errors or warnings.
-   [ ] **Backend API Test (AC: #3):**
    -   [ ] Create a test API route in the Next.js app (e.g., `/pages/api/test-backend.ts`).
    -   [ ] In this API route, make a `fetch` request to the backend's health check endpoint (e.g., `http://localhost:8000/health`).
    -   [ ] Create a simple frontend page/component with a button to trigger the test API route.
    -   [ ] **Testing:** Verify that clicking the button successfully calls the backend and displays a success message.

## Dev Notes

*   **Relevant architecture patterns and constraints**:
    *   **Frontend Technology:** Next.js (v16.0.5+) with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS.
    *   **State Management:** `Zustand` for client-side state, `SWR` or `React Query` for server-side state (data fetching), as per `tech-spec-epic-1.md`.
    *   **Styling:** Utility-first CSS using Tailwind CSS.
    *   **Authentication:** The frontend will interact directly with Supabase Auth for user registration and login.
*   **Source tree components to touch**:
    *   A new `frontend/` directory will be created and populated by `create-next-app`.
    *   `frontend/.env.local` for environment variables.
    *   `frontend/src/lib/supabaseClient.ts` for the Supabase client.
    *   `frontend/src/app/` for pages and components.
*   **Testing standards summary**:
    *   Frontend unit tests will use `React Testing Library` with `Jest`.
    *   Integration tests will focus on Frontend-Backend API communication.
    *   E2E tests will be considered in a future phase (`Playwright` or `Cypress`).

### Learnings from Previous Story

*   The previous story, `1-1-core-backend-setup`, successfully established the backend infrastructure. However, the `Dev Agent Record` in that story was not populated with completion notes or a file list. This information would have been valuable for understanding the exact state of the backend implementation. For this story, it is important to ensure the `Dev Agent Record` is fully completed upon finishing the implementation.

### Project Structure Notes

- The initial setup will be generated by `create-next-app`. The structure should adhere to Next.js conventions.
- A `lib/` or `utils/` directory should be created for shared utilities like the Supabase client.
- Components should be organized logically within the `src/` or `app/` directory.
