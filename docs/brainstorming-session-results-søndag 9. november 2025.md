# Brainstorming Session Results

**Session Date:** søndag 9. november 2025
**Facilitator:** {{agent_role}} {{agent_name}}
**Participant:** BIP

## Executive Summary

**Topic:** Open-ended exploration for the AI Fitness & Meal Planner project.

**Session Goals:** To uncover new ideas, opportunities, and potential blind spots not yet considered in the project proposal.

**Techniques Used:** Assumption Reversal

**Total Ideas Generated:** 1 Core Requirement

### Key Themes Identified:

The session pivoted from open-ended creative brainstorming to a focused technical review of the project proposal, indicating a need to solidify the core product definition before expanding its scope.

## Technique Sessions

**Assumption Reversal:**
- **Initial Assumption:** Users want the app to make healthy living easier and faster.
- **Reversal Explored:** What if users wanted the app to be more engaging and deliberate, even if it required more effort?
- **Outcome:** This line of inquiry led to a discussion about the user's first-time experience and the importance of a strong initial engagement, which then transitioned into a review of the project's technical foundations.

## Idea Categorization

### Immediate Opportunities

- Refine the user onboarding process to be more diagnostic and persona-driven.

### Future Innovations

N/A

### Moonshots

N/A

### Insights and Learnings

The most valuable insight from this session was the need to address potential gaps in the core AI and technical specifications before proceeding with broader feature brainstorming. The "Cold Start" problem for new users was identified as a critical risk to user retention. Additionally, the discussion on offline functionality led to a clear definition of "Basic Offline Support" to enhance user experience.

## Action Planning

### Top 3 Priority Ideas

#### #1 Priority: Refine the Onboarding and First Plan Generation process.

- Rationale: The first plan a user receives is critical for retention. A generic plan risks immediate user churn. A new, persona-driven, diagnostic approach will improve user engagement and provide the AI with better calibration data.
- Next steps: Update the `proposal.md` to include the new "Refined Onboarding & First Plan Generation" requirement.
- Resources needed: N/A (specification change)
- Timeline: Immediate

#### #2 Priority: Implement Basic Offline Support.

- Rationale: To ensure a robust user experience, especially in environments with limited connectivity (e.g., gyms), basic offline capabilities are essential for viewing plans and logging activities.
- Next steps: Update the `proposal.md` to include the "Basic Offline Support" requirement.
- Resources needed: N/A (specification change)
- Timeline: Immediate

#### #3 Priority: {{priority_3_name}}

- Rationale: {{priority_3_rationale}}
- Next steps: {{priority_3_steps}}
- Resources needed: {{priority_3_resources}}
- Timeline: {{priority_3_timeline}}

## Reflection and Follow-up

### What Worked Well

Pivoting from broad brainstorming to a focused technical review was highly effective and yielded a concrete, actionable requirement.

### Areas for Further Exploration

- The other identified AI and Technical gaps in the proposal.

### Recommended Follow-up Techniques

- Continue with a structured review of the remaining technical gaps.

### Questions That Emerged

- How can we ensure the AI feedback loop is specific and effective?
- How do we ensure long-term variety in AI-generated plans?
- What is the specific data privacy policy regarding third-party AI services?

### Next Session Planning

- **Suggested topics:** Continue with the AI Gaps analysis.
- **Recommended timeframe:** Next session.
- **Preparation needed:** None.
