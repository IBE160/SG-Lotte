fix(frontend): Finalize onboarding API call URL and authorization

Addresses persistent issues with the onboarding finish API call by directly targeting the backend and ensuring correct URL formatting.

This commit makes the following changes in `frontend/src/app/(auth)/onboarding/page.tsx`:
- The API call for user profile updates (`/api/v1/users/profile`) now directly targets the FastAPI backend using `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` (or a fallback to `http://127.0.0.1:8000`), bypassing Next.js rewrites.
- The endpoint URL is precisely set to `/api/v1/users/profile` (without a trailing slash), to avoid potential 307/308 redirects that could lead to the Authorization header being dropped.
- The Authorization header continues to be correctly attached using `session.access_token`, which is validated for its presence before the request is made.
This aligns the API call mechanism with a more robust pattern, resolving the missing Authorization header issue observed in previous attempts.
